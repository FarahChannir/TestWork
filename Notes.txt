1- I've  not completed the broadcast functionality for clients' actions during auctions.

2- The option to end an auction and view the results is currently unavailable.

3- I've created a simulator for testing purposes.

4- I've configured multiple instances by running clients through the exe file in the client project's bin folder.

5- I've conducted additional tests for various P2P types, and details are included in the rar file.

Grateful for the opportunity to conduct these tests. Thank you!
